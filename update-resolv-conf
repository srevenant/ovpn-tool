# Note: ideally networKManager would handle this via dnsmasq, but it doesn't
# appear to handle this dynamically as of yet.  So we'll just clobber it.
# We run the risk that NeworkManager will replace it later..

# Parses DHCP options from openvpn to update resolv.conf
# To use set as 'up' and 'down' script in your openvpn *.conf:
# up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
# down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
#
# Used snippets of resolvconf script by Thomas Hood and Chris Hanson.

# Example envs set from openvpn:
#
#     foreign_option_1='dhcp-option DNS 193.43.27.132'
#     foreign_option_2='dhcp-option DNS 193.43.27.133'
#     foreign_option_3='dhcp-option DOMAIN be.bnc.ch'

# resolv.conf needs to be readable by all
